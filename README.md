## Tool Name
Open Telemetry
## Tool Description
The industry is beginning to aligning on the OpenTelemetry specification for vendor and language agnostic tracing across systems. One of the blockers of us adopting OpenTelemetry in athenaNet is the lack of a good perl client. This initiative involves building out an OpenTelemetry compliant perl library along with instrumentation of various points of interest for tracing in athenaNet.
## Is the tool open for community contributions? (YES/NO) 
YES
## User Goals

1. Building an OpenTelemetry compliant perl tracing library and instrumenting our codebase
2. Deployment of jaeger agent to on-premise hosts
3. Deployment of jaeger to AWS (Collector / Kafka / Ingester / ElasticSearch / Query UI)
